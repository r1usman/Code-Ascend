    "Description": "Zookeeper is buying a carton of fruit to feed his pet wabbit. The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string $s_1s_2\\ldots s_n$ of length $n$. $1$ represents an apple and $0$ represents an orange.\n\nSince wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longest contiguous sequence of apples. Let $f(l,r)$ be the longest contiguous sequence of apples in the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1}\\ldots s_{r}$. \n\nHelp Zookeeper find $\\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$, or the sum of $f$ across all substrings.",
    "Input": "The first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5)$.\n\n The next line contains a binary string $s$ of length $n$ $(s_i \\in \\{0,1\\})$",
    "Output": "Print a single integer: $\\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$.",
    "Examples": [
        {
            "input": "4\n0110",
            "output": "12"
        },
        {
            "input": "7\n1101001",
            "output": "30"
        },
        {
            "input": "12\n011100011100",
            "output": "156"
        }
    ],
    "Note": "In the first test, there are ten substrings. The list of them (we let $[l,r]$ be the substring $s_l s_{l+1} \\ldots s_r$):  $[1,1]$: 0  $[1,2]$: 01  $[1,3]$: 011  $[1,4]$: 0110  $[2,2]$: 1  $[2,3]$: 11  $[2,4]$: 110  $[3,3]$: 1  $[3,4]$: 10  $[4,4]$: 0 \n\nThe lengths of the longest contiguous sequence of ones in each of these ten substrings are $0,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,0$ respectively. Hence, the answer is $0+1+2+2+1+2+2+1+1+0 = 12$."
