    "Description": "A $\\mathbf{0}$-indexed array $a$ of size $n$ is called good if for all valid indices $i$ ($0 \\le i \\le n-1$), $a_i + i$ is a perfect square$^\\dagger$.\n\nGiven an integer $n$. Find a permutation$^\\ddagger$ $p$ of $[0,1,2,\\ldots,n-1]$ that is good or determine that no such permutation exists.\n\n$^\\dagger$ An integer $x$ is said to be a perfect square if there exists an integer $y$ such that $x = y^2$.\n\n$^\\ddagger$ An array $b$ is a permutation of an array $a$ if $b$ consists of the elements of $a$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[4,2,3,4]$ is a permutation of $[3,2,4,4]$ while $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation of $[1,2,3]$.",
    "Input": "The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) — the length of the permutation $p$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.",
    "Output": "For each test case, output $n$ distinct integers $p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{n-1}$ ($0 \\le p_i \\le n-1$) — the permutation $p$ — if the answer exists, and $-1$ otherwise.",
    "Examples": [
        {
            "input": "3\n3\n4\n7",
            "output": "1 0 2\n0 3 2 1\n1 0 2 6 5 4 3"
        }
    ],
    "Note": "In the first test case, we have $n=3$. The array $p = [1, 0, 2]$ is good since $1 + 0 = 1^2$, $0 + 1 = 1^2$, and $2 + 2 = 2^2$\n\nIn the second test case, we have $n=4$. The array $p = [0, 3, 2, 1]$ is good since $0 + 0 = 0^2$, $3 + 1 = 2^2$, $2+2 = 2^2$, and $1+3 = 2^2$."
